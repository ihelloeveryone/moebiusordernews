  "content": "Moebius Order is established as a creator-driven digital publishing organization dedicated to the development of original worlds, connected universes, and long-term creative projects across multiple mediums.\n\nThe organization is structured to support continuity, coherence, and creative integrity over time.

Future updates will outline publishing initiatives, flagship projects, and ongoing developments as the organization expands its creative ecosystem.",
